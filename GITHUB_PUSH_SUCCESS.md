## 🌿 Branch Strategy

Your repository now has two branches:

1. **`main`** - Your SMB version (untouched, preserved)
2. **`enterprise-development`** - Your Enterprise version (just pushed)

This keeps both versions separate and safe!

---

## ⚠️ Important Note: Large Video File

GitHub detected a large video file:
- File: `nextjs_space/public/videos/process-hero.mp4` (59.77 MB)
- This exceeds GitHub's recommended 50 MB limit
- **The file was pushed successfully**, but you may want to consider:
  - Using Git LFS (Large File Storage) for large media files
  - Hosting videos externally (YouTube, Vimeo, CDN)
  - Compressing the video file

If you want to set up Git LFS, visit: https://git-lfs.github.com/

## 🔒 Security Reminder

**Important**: Your Personal Access Token has been used and is no longer needed.

For security, you should:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find the token you just created
3. Click "Delete" (or keep it if you plan to push more changes)

Your `.env` file with database credentials was **NOT** pushed (it's in `.gitignore`), so your secrets are safe.
